# Description of the files

Please note that these codes here are meant to demonstrate part of my attempt in becoming better at both progeramming and the concept that I was studing at the time. In that regard, some codes contain my own experimentation/exploration of different ideas and are not about a particular example or problem!

konstantinos: contains my codes for some of the examples and exercises in [Computational Physics - A Practical Introduction to Computational Physics and Scientific Computing (using C++)](https://www.amazon.com/Computational-Physics-Practical-Introduction-Scientific/dp/1365583228/ref=d_pd_sbs_vft_none_sccl_2_1/141-6523749-4384434?pd_rd_w=NZKn6&content-id=amzn1.sym.3676f086-9496-4fd7-8490-77cf7f43f846&pf_rd_p=3676f086-9496-4fd7-8490-77cf7f43f846&pf_rd_r=T2NA24GDW1C9M9HBNF1P&pd_rd_wg=cDZqB&pd_rd_r=433721da-8616-4c37-bc18-261763132bf1&pd_rd_i=1365583228&psc=1). Please note that file names are abbreviated. For instance, file name "ch2p99" means chapter 2 page 99.

zingale: contains a series of my codes on Prof. Zingle's [course home works](http://bender.astro.sunysb.edu/classes/numerical_methods/). Please note that file names are abbreviated. For instance, file name "hm2e1pc" means homework2, exercise 1, part c.
